# EGPS Logo Design Brief

## Company
- **Name:** Eurogulf Power Solutions (EGPS)
- **Parent:** BSS (see bss-logo-reference.jpg)
- **Industry:** Ship parts supply, engine repairs/overhaul, marine engineering
- **Location:** Dubai (subsidiary of BSS operating in Middle East)

## BSS Logo Analysis
- Bold geometric uppercase letters "BSS"
- Horizontal lines running through the letterforms (venetian blind / scan-line effect)
- Pure black & white, high contrast
- No icon — purely typographic
- Industrial, heavy, confident feel
- Letters interlock/overlap slightly

## Requirements
- 20 distinct logo variants
- Mix of: "EGPS" shortform, "Eurogulf Power Solutions" full name, combined layouts
- Should reference/echo BSS's style (geometric, industrial) but evolve it
- Some variants closer to BSS style, some more adventurous
- Color exploration welcome (navy/gold for Dubai+maritime, industrial grays, etc.)
- Some variants with icons (engine, turbine, propeller — but NOT cliché anchors/waves)
- Some purely typographic like BSS
- Must look premium and modern — this is a Dubai engineering firm
- NOT generic maritime clip-art. Think: industrial precision, power, engineering excellence

## Deliverable
Single `index.html` file — a beautiful presentation dashboard showing all 20 logos with:
- Each logo as inline SVG (scalable, crisp)
- Brief description explaining the design rationale
- Dark and light background previews
- Organized in a gallery grid
- Professional, polished presentation
- The dashboard itself should look impressive (this goes to the client)

## Style Directions to Explore (mix across 20 variants)
1. **BSS Echo** — Same horizontal line technique on EGPS letters
2. **Geometric Blocks** — Modular, grid-based letterforms
3. **Stencil Industrial** — Military/industrial stencil aesthetic
4. **Minimal Mark** — Ultra-clean, Helvetica-like precision
5. **Dynamic Power** — Angles suggesting motion/turbines/energy
6. **Gulf Luxury** — Gold accents, refined serif elements for Dubai market
7. **Technical Blueprint** — Engineering drawing aesthetic
8. **Interlocking** — Letters that connect mechanically
9. **Negative Space** — Clever use of negative space in letterforms
10. **Monogram Crest** — Shield/crest format with EGPS monogram
