# Task: EGPS Logos Batch 2 (Variants 11-20)

Read BRIEF.md and CLAUDE.md for full context + bss-logo-reference.jpg for BSS style.

Create `batch2.html` — a standalone HTML file with 10 inline SVG logo variants for EGPS.

## Variants 11-20 (creative explorations):
11. Propeller Abstract — stylized propeller/turbine integrated into E or G
12. Dual-tone Split — letterforms split between two contrasting colors
13. Circuit/Technical — PCB/technical line patterns within letters
14. Maritime Deco — Art Deco meets marine engineering
15. Brutalist Heavy — ultra-bold, raw concrete/steel aesthetic
16. Modular Assembly — letters built from repeating geometric units
17. Horizon Line — letters emerging from/intersecting a horizon
18. Precision Instrument — dial/gauge aesthetic integrated into typography
19. Layered Depth — overlapping translucent letterforms creating depth
20. Signature Bold — confident hand-drawn quality with industrial backbone

## Rules:
- Each logo = inline SVG, genuinely different designs (NOT color swaps)
- Include brief description/rationale per logo
- Show each on dark AND light background
- Gallery grid layout, professional presentation
- The HTML itself should look impressive
- Use distinctive typography (Google Fonts OK), CSS variables, animations on load
- KEEP SVGs CLEAN but detailed enough to look premium
- Total output MUST stay under 25000 tokens — be efficient with SVG paths

When done, run: openclaw system event --text 'Batch 2 done: projects/egps-logos/batch2.html' --mode now
