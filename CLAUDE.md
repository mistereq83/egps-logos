# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Generate creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Design Guidelines
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. CSS-only preferred. Staggered reveals on load.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds**: Create atmosphere and depth. Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns.

NEVER use generic AI aesthetics (Inter, Roboto, purple gradients on white, cookie-cutter layouts).

## Logo-Specific Notes
- Each logo MUST be inline SVG (no external images)
- SVGs should be clean, well-structured, scalable
- Use SVG features: paths, masks, clip-paths, gradients, patterns
- The horizontal-line effect from BSS can be achieved with SVG pattern fills or clip-paths
- Make each of the 20 logos genuinely DIFFERENT — not just color swaps
- Some should be purely typographic, some with icon marks
- Test readability at small sizes (favicon-like) and large sizes
