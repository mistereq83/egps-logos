# Task: EGPS Logos Batch 1 (Variants 1-10)

Read BRIEF.md and CLAUDE.md for full context + bss-logo-reference.jpg for BSS style.

Create `batch1.html` — a standalone HTML file with 10 inline SVG logo variants for EGPS.

## Variants 1-10 (style directions):
1. BSS Echo — horizontal scan-line technique on EGPS letters
2. Geometric Blocks — modular grid-based letterforms  
3. Stencil Industrial — military/industrial stencil aesthetic
4. Minimal Mark — ultra-clean precision typography
5. Dynamic Power — angles suggesting turbines/energy/motion
6. Gulf Luxury — gold accents, refined serif for Dubai
7. Technical Blueprint — engineering drawing aesthetic
8. Interlocking — mechanically connecting letters
9. Negative Space — clever use in letterforms
10. Monogram Crest — shield/crest with EGPS monogram

## Rules:
- Each logo = inline SVG, genuinely different designs (NOT color swaps)
- Include brief description/rationale per logo
- Show each on dark AND light background
- Gallery grid layout, professional presentation
- The HTML itself should look impressive
- Use distinctive typography (Google Fonts OK), CSS variables, animations on load
- KEEP SVGs CLEAN but detailed enough to look premium
- Total output MUST stay under 25000 tokens — be efficient with SVG paths

When done, run: openclaw system event --text 'Batch 1 done: projects/egps-logos/batch1.html' --mode now
