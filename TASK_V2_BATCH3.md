# Task: EGPS Logos V2 — Batch 3 (Variants 21-30): BSS Connection

Read BRIEF_V2.md for full context and CLAUDE.md for design guidelines.
Look at bss-logo-reference.jpg — this is the BSS parent brand logo. Key features:
- Bold geometric uppercase "BSS" with horizontal scan-lines running through the letters
- Pure black & white, high contrast, industrial
- Letters slightly interlock/overlap

**⚠️ CRITICAL: "Euro Gulf" = TWO WORDS. Never "Eurogulf".**

Create `v2_batch3.html` — standalone HTML with 10 inline SVG logo variants (21-30).

## Theme: BSS Parent Brand Connection
All 10 variants must visually connect EGPS to its parent company BSS. Approaches:

21. **Powered by BSS** — "EURO GULF POWER SOLUTIONS" main logo + small "powered by BSS" lockup beneath, BSS in its scan-line style
22. **BSS Scan-Line DNA** — EGPS letters rendered with the SAME horizontal scan-line technique as BSS logo, direct visual inheritance
23. **Dual Brand Lockup** — BSS logo (scan-lines) on left + divider + Euro Gulf wordmark on right, formal co-brand
24. **BSS Endorsement Badge** — "A BSS Company" badge/seal integrated below or beside EGPS wordmark
25. **Shared Geometry** — Both BSS and EGPS using same geometric letter construction system, family resemblance
26. **Heritage Line** — "Euro Gulf Power Solutions" with "Est. BSS Group" in refined heritage typography
27. **Monogram Fusion** — BSS + EGPS monograms interlocked/overlapping as unified mark
28. **Scan-Line Gradient** — BSS scan-line technique on EGPS but evolved — lines fade/gradient, showing evolution from parent
29. **Corporate Stack** — Formal corporate layout: EGPS large + "A subsidiary of BSS" + horizontal rule, investor-deck style
30. **Brand Bridge** — Creative transition where BSS letterforms morph/connect into EGPS letterforms

## Rules:
- Each logo = inline SVG, genuinely different designs
- "Euro Gulf" always TWO words
- BSS references must use the scan-line horizontal stripe technique from the reference image
- Show each on dark AND light background
- Gallery grid, professional presentation
- Google Fonts OK, CSS animations on load
- Keep SVGs efficient — stay under 25000 output tokens
- Color palette: navy/gold/cream from V2, but BSS elements can be black/white
